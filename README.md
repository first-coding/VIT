# Vision-Transformer (ViT) for CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
This project implements the Vision Transformer (ViT) model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The Vision Transformer is a state-of-the-art architecture for image classification tasks, leveraging the power of self-attention mechanisms.

## Features
Utilizes the latest advancements in deep learning for image classification.
Integrates the powerful capabilities of transformers into computer vision tasks.
Provides a robust and efficient solution for handling image data.

## Key Components
Patch Embedding: Extracts image patches and converts them into token embeddings.
Attention Mechanism: Captures global dependencies and relationships between tokens.
MLP Layers: Employs multi-layer perceptrons for non-linear transformations.
Transformer Blocks: Comprises attention layers followed by feed-forward neural networks.
Vision Transformer (ViT) Model: Combines these components into a cohesive architecture.
